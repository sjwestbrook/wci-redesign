                <p>Becky had the perception that all college students were young. It was a perception that was proved false to her when she returned to college after losing her job as a Certified Nursing Assistant at Benedictine Manor in Aradia when it closed in 2014.</p>
                <p class="italic">"When I thought of college, I thought of all kids, but it's not. There's a lot of older people in school."</p>
                <p>After losing her job, she began meeting with a Workforce Connections Employment Coordinator. Her employment coordinator helped Becky apply for unemployment, assisted with revamping her resume, and the two came up with a plan for Becky's future.</p>
                <p>It was during these meetings that Becky decided to return to college to become a renal dialysis technician. Becky was also provided with transportation and tuition assistance through the Workforce Investment Act.</p>
                <p>Becky has two semesters remaining at Chippewa Valley Technical College in Eau Claire and has made the President's List each of her previous semesters. She says goig back to school after being out for 27 hasn't always been easy, but it's a decision she's glad she made.</p>
                <p class="italic">"I've had a lot of support from my family, counselors at school, and my employment coordinator. I cannot say enough good things about these people."</p>

                <p>Tacarra relocated to the La Crosse area in search of a larger city that offered more training and employment opportunities. Before coming to the area, she provided in-home healthcare and other household support.</p>
                <p>Tacarra came to Workforce Connections wanting to complete a Certified Nursing Assistant program, but without the money to pay for the program, she didn’t know how to get started on the life path she envisioned.</p>
                <p>Workforce Connections was able to help her with tuition assistance as well as encouragement and became a place for her to ask questions.</p>
                <p>After earning her CNA certificate, Tacarra was able to get a job and has quickly advanced in the company.</p>

                <p>Cutbacks. It was a dreaded word that became a reality for Heather. In 2008, after working more than 8 years at a local nonprofit organization, she became a casualty of cutbacks. She was feeling good, however, when she was able to find a temporary position that she thought was going to become a permanent position. That did not happen and this time, with no severance package to fall back on Heather, was left searching for a job that would fit her unique skills while allowing her to pay the bills.</p>
                <p>It was during the time of searching for a new job that Heather began attending workshops and meeting with an employment coordinator at Workforce
Connections.</p>
                <p class="italic">“In my very first workshop it became abundantly clear to me that I should have been there all along. The game had changed significantly since I graduated from college in 1995.”</p>
                <p>Heather’s employment coordinator was able to assist Heather with interview clothes, fuel and support.</p>
                <p class="italic">“They cheered me on when things went well and helped me to process when things didn’t. There was never any doubt that they all cared about me and wanted to see me succeed."</p>
                <p>It was 10 months into the job searching process that Heather found the job she really wanted with the Salvation Army. She says the interview couldn’t have gone better, but she then received the dreaded letter informing her she had not been chosen for the position.</p>
                <p>After the rejection letter, Heather says she did something she had never done before and something she learned at a workshop. She sent another thank you note acknowledging she was disappointed she wasn’t chosen for the position, but knew a difficult decision had to be made.</p>
                <p>Later that day, she received a phone call wondering if she was interested in a seasonal position. Heather accepted. While waiting for the position to begin the person who was originally hired for the other position decided not to take the job. Heather was then offered the job she originally applied for.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I have been the Volunteer Coordinator with The Salvation Army for just over four months now and everything is going very well. It’s all because I sent them a little note to say I am still interested, something that it would have never occurred to me to do before.”</p>

                <p>Tammy came to Workforce Connections stressed and lacking confidence after losing her job of 20 years at Fort McCoy working with Army lodging. Through hard work and the assistance of her Employment Coordinator she was able to gain self-confidence and a new career.</p>
                <p>Tammy was interested in a healthcare career, but thought her age and the toughness of courses would prevent her from reaching this dream. However, with tuition and fuel assistance from Workforce Connections, she was able to work her way through school and earned a Certified Nursing Assistant certificate, phlebotomy certificate and a Medical Assistant degree. She is now employed at an area hospital and loving her job.</p>
                <p>Tammy says she doesn’t know where she would be without the help of her Employment Coordinator and she is very thankful for all the assistance she received.</p>

                <p>Her company’s downsizing nearly a year ago left Korrin without a job and not sure where to turn for help with job applications and networking. Once she heard about Workforce Connections she felt the organization would be able to help her with both of these.</p>
                <p>Korrin’s Employment Coordinator helped her perfect her resume and cover letter and also worked on job development and career counseling. Originally her resume wasn’t garnering much attention, but with some changes her Employment Coordinator suggested, she was able to get many more interviews. Korrin also became better at marketing her own skills.</p>
                <p>Korrin was offered and accepted a job as a Production Control Manager and has also enrolled in school to further her education.</p>

                <p>Mathew came to Workforce Connections with years of welding experience, a criminal record and was having a hard time finding a job. After meeting with his Employment Coordinator he decided to enroll in a welding skills institute held by Western Technical College.</p>
                <p>The 12-week institute, held in Black River Falls, helped Mathew with his technical welding skills, which helped him find a temporary job at Bimbo Bakery. A few months later, he applied and was hired at Trane Company. He has been employed at the company since the end of July and enjoying his time there. Mathew believes perfect timing and the certificate he earned through the welding skills institute is what led to his employment</p>
                <p>Looking to the future, Mathew would like to continue his education in machining or welding.</p>

                <p>Rosana had medically verified barriers to employment including extreme anxiety when she enrolled in the W-2 program.</p>
                <p>She showed up to her appointments every week, always put in her best effort in. Her hard work paid off less than one month after enrolling in the program when she was hired at Menards.</p>
                <p>She made quick strides at her job and was able to move from the cashier position to the coveted garden center and also began training for a service desk position. The cross-training has the potential to lead to management.</p>
                <p>Rosana is loving her job and her anxiety has disappeared to the point where her therapist took her off all medication. She smiles all the time, works as many shifts as she’s given and is always willing to pick up shifts from her co-workers.</p>
                <p class="italic">“Rosana is now able to pay her own rent and have money to live on. She couldn’t be happier.”</p>

                <p>He said that the FSET program helped him to find his own voice, and also teach him how to go about finding, starting, and leaving employment the right away.</p>
                <p>He is now happily working as a security officer for Ho Chunk Gaming, which is in line with what he wanted to do.</p>

                <p>Anthony enrolled in the FSET program with the goal of finding a job working fulltime in a kitchen where he would have the opportunity to grow within the company.</p>
                <p>His employment coordinator was able to help him create a resume and offered interview tips and suggestions on followthrough for applications that Anthony completed.</p>
                <p>WCI also assisted with transportation by paying for Anthony to receive his temporary driver’s license; the first step to obtaining his permanent license.</p>
                <p>Anthony’s employment coordinator assisted him with an online application to the Mauston Kwik Trip, which required five to seven references.</p>
                <p>Anthony was offered employment and began working in June. WCI was also able to help him by reimbursing him for his work uniform.</p>
                <p>Anthony says his supervisors have already started hinting that he may soon get additional duties, including cooking.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="modal-body">
                <p class="italic">“I don’t want to go back to prison. I have to have a job. I have to be able to take care of my son.”</p>
                <p> Miranda said those words and is now living by them.</p>
                <p>She came to Wisconsin Works (W-2), a program administered by Workforce Connections, Inc., with a newborn son and a criminal record after problems with methamphetamines had landed her in jail. She also came with the resolve to not go back to prison and to support herself and her son.</p>
                <p>Miranda had been out of prison for a little more than a year and because of her record was having a hard time finding a job.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I wasn’t going to lie on a job application. People see meth and it scares them. I’m not a bad person. I’m a hard worker. I made some bad decisions.”</p>
                <p>Sarah Jackson of Workforce Connections, Inc. placed Miranda through the W-2 Trial Jobs program at TLC Center in La Crosse. TLC Center was started as a way of giving back to the community and offers clothing, furniture and other items at a low cost to its customers.</p>
                <p>Sarah describes trial jobs as “a bridge between the W-2 program and employment” and it helps participants “feel like they are on their way.” </p>
                <p>Within two weeks of starting at TLC, Miranda was offered a position and within six weeks of that she was promoted to a supervisory role.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I was put there for a reason. It’s been a blessing; a major blessing.”</p>
                <p> Sarah believes Miranda’s take-charge attitude has contributed to her successes.</p>
                <p class="italic">“[Miranda] knew that she was at a crossroads in her life and she made the decision to carve out her path,” Sarah said. “She chose to be motivated, to succeed, and she was committed to performing with integrity on the work site.”</p>
                <p>Miranda loves her job and the variety it offers her. Some days she spends sorting through donations while other days she spends running the Center and the Food Pantry.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I really, really enjoy that. I get to meet all sorts of people and I get a sense of helping people. With my background it’s nice to be helping – not taking from the community anymore.”</p>
                <p>Miranda said if she hadn’t taken the first step and come to Workforce Connections, Inc. she doesn’t know where she would be today.</p>
                <p class="italic">“If I was still unemployed and had a new baby I would probably be a little down. I definitely would not have had this opportunity had I not come in [to Workforce Connections, Inc.].”</p>

              </div>
              <div class="modal-body">
                <p>There is life after prison. It’s something Tina set out to prove. Now looking back on the past 10 years of her life, Tina isn’t proud of the mistake she made, but has learned from it. In 2003 Tina and her husband were having a lot of marital issues.</p>
                <p class="italic">“At that time in my life I was pretty crushed. He was the father of my children. Instead of going to a psychologist, I started talking to one of my daughter’s friends.”</p>
                <p>Eventually, things crossed the line. Tina went to the authorities and told them what she had done. She spent 4 years in prison and is currently finishing up 4 ½ years of probation.</p>
                <p class="italic">“If it wasn’t for my faith, I don’t think I would have made it in prison. I didn’t have problems while in prison and have never been incompliant with my probation officer.”</p>
                <p>Once out of prison, Tina was able to secure different jobs, but she was always let go after a background check was completed. Tina was determined to keep her head up.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I know I’m a good person. I made a mistake, but I thought: there’s someone that has to give me a job.”</p>
                <p>Tina got what seemed like her big break when she landed a job with a local company. But that too ended with her being dismissed, this time because of health issues. Tina was diagnosed with cancer and radiation treatments forced her to miss a lot of work. </p>
                <p>Tina started submitting about six applications a week once she was healthy but struggled to find an employer who would overlook her past. That was when Tina walked into the Wisconsin Job Center in La Crosse, started attending workshops and met Sarah Saito of Workforce Connections, Inc. and Myron Daubert of Job Services. From the beginning, Sarah, who served Tina under the Workforce Investment Act, knew Tina would be a tremendous asset to a company.</p>
                <p class="italic">“Tina is a pleasure to work with. She’s determined, positive, and has an inspiring outlook on life.”</p>
                <p>Like in Tina’s situation, Myron said it’s always beneficial when two agencies can work together for the good of a job seeker.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I know from working quite a bit with Sarah that our services are complementary and reinforcing. We both have quality and insightful contributions to make toward helping job seekers and these similar but varying perspectives help to enhance the job seeker’s understanding of effective courses of action.”</p>
                <p>Working with Sarah and Myron led Tina to believe that just because she’s a felon, it does not mean she can’t get a job. Tina knew she wanted a job in customer service because she enjoys helping people. She worked at a local company before prison and applied there several times after prison. She reapplied in July, was honest with the employer about her past and was hired on at the beginning of August.</p>
                <p class="italic">“I just needed that chance. My mistakes are a cross that I have to carry for the rest of my life, but that doesn’t mean I can’t still have a successful life.”</p>

                <p>Mallett recently graduated from high school, is registered to begin classes at Western Technical College and also just started a new job at Men’s Warehouse. He needed a reliable vehicle to travel to and from work.</p>
